## CS 497: Advanced Database Systems (Fall 2023)
* **Staff:** [Andrew Crotty](https://users.cs.northwestern.edu/~ajc4828/) (Instructor), [Zheng Zhang](https://secantzhang.github.io/) (TA)
* **Day/Time:** MW 3:30-4:50pm
* **Location:** [University Library 3370](https://25live.collegenet.com/pro/northwestern#!/home/location/152/details)

### Description
This course will provide a comprehensive overview of the internals of modern
database management systems (DBMSs), specifically focusing on the core concepts
behind online analytical query processing (OLAP). It is intended for graduate
and advanced undergraduate students interested in systems research. Students
will learn how to: (1) read and evaluate systems research papers, with emphasis
on constructive criticism; (2) identify tradeoffs and justify design decisions
related to the architecture of an OLAP DBMS; (3) craft and deliver presentations
that distill core research ideas; and (4) plan and execute a final project that
answers an interesting systems research question.

### Grading
The goal of this course is to prepare students to independently tackle systems
research problems with a heavy emphasis on implementation and experimental
validation of hypotheses, so it will not include traditional exams or homework
assignments. Instead, students will be evaluated as follows:

##### Compression Project – 40%
For this project, students will be given 3 real-world datasets with the goal of
compressing them as much as possible by combining and extending the techniques
discussed in class. Students may work individually or in pairs to complete this
project. The project deliverables include:

* Project presentation (5-10 minutes, modeled after a short conference talk) - 5%
* Written report (at least 4 pages excluding references, modeled after a workshop paper) - 10%
* Programming component (code, benchmarks, demo, etc.) - 25%

##### Encyclopedia Article – 10%
The [Database of Databases](https://dbdb.io/) is an online encyclopedia of DBMSs
maintained by the [CMU Database Group](https://db.cs.cmu.edu/). Students may
work individually or in pairs to write an article of their choice on an approved
DBMS. Additional information is available here:
https://15721.courses.cs.cmu.edu/spring2023/project2.html

##### Final Project – 50%
Students may work individually or in pairs to complete a final project of their
choice on an approved topic related to the course content. The project
deliverables include:

* Project proposal (5-10 minutes, modeled after a short conference talk) - 5%
* Project presentation (20-30 minutes, modeled after a full conference talk) - 10%
* Written report (at least 6 pages excluding references, modeled after a conference paper) - 10%
* Programming component (code, benchmarks, demo, etc.) - 25%

### Additional Information
Please see below for additional course policies and information.

##### Plagiarism
Plagiarism will not be tolerated. You may not copy (including minor rewording)
directly from papers, outside sources, or other students. You are free to borrow
from publicly available presentation materials (e.g., slides, images) and code
with proper attribution, but what you produce should not simply be a facsimile
of someone else's work. If at all in doubt about whether something is
acceptable, please reach out to ask for clarification. See Northwestern's
policies on Academic Integrity for additional information:
https://www.northwestern.edu/provost/policies-procedures/academic-integrity/

##### Late Policy
This course has no formal provisions for late submission, and all dates (e.g.,
presentations, final project deadlines) are firm. Extreme circumstances (e.g.,
medical emergencies) will be accommodated with the appropriate written
documentation (e.g., a doctor's note).

##### Accommodations
Northwestern is committed to fostering an inclusive and supportive environment
